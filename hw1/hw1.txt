Problem 1.

	Part (a): Looking up information relevant to the course online. Asking the course staff for help. Discussing high
	level ideas with a classmate so long as you do not break 
	the "Hearthstone Rule."


	Part (b): Raise an issue within 1 week of receiving the
	grade by Assigning the issue to your grader on GitHub. If 
	the problem is not resolved, then Go see a course TA if 
	assigning the issue to your grader did not resolve your 
	concern.


	Part (c): Eclipse, GNU emacs, Microsoft Visual Studio,
	sublime


	Part (d): Each student has 3 late days of which only one 
	can be used per HW.

	Part (e): Complete the online submission form as you would 
	for an on-time submission - except when you get to step 4,
	you confirm you are using a late date.

Problem 2. 

	Part (a): None of the GUI-based applications are supported. 
	Only through the git command line interface in the 
	course VM.


	Part (b): Avoid Cloning into a folder that itself is a git
	repo. There is not a point to cloning a sync-ed folder like 
	DropBox.


	Part (c):
		1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
		2. git log -p -3


	Part (d):
